Let's Get Mental is a fundraiser campaign created by Jaccy which aims including:
    - Promoting positive mental health
    - Decreasing the stigma surrounding depression and other life-threatening mental illnesses
    - Encouraging individuals to seek professional help when required

Whilst most of us pay attention to our physical health, we always seem to neglect our minds and our mental health.
Unfortunately, this can result in mental illnesses which can have long-lasting negative effects on both
the individuals themselves and the people around them.
According to Samaritans, a mental health organisation set up in the United Kingdom, one-sixth of the population
will have a mental illness at any given time.
The most common mental illnesses include depression and anxiety, which can affect and individuals' mood, confidence
and self-esteem. It can also be linked to eating disorders such as anorexia, social issues such as making bonds
with family members and friends among many other negative effects.
The most destructive effect which can surface is suicidal tendencies - both fleeting and consistent.
Using statistics from the 2018 Suicide Report conducted by Samaritans, depression and anxiety has lead to nearly 7,000 deaths within the UK alone in 2018 and is the leading
cause of death within young people (described as being between 15 and 24).
Real change needs to happen as soon as possible. However, steps can be taken now to decrease this ever-growing number, especially in Scotland where the suicide rate is 
the highest within the United Kingdom.
Let's Get Mental has been started to help bring awareness to these issues close to my heart. Throughout the course of this event, livestreamers 
will be creating content to spread knowledge on mental health as well as to raise donations. All of the proceeds will be directly given to the Scottish Association for 
Mental Health when it closes. With your support, you can make a difference. Thank you.

Below, you can find some of the livestreamers who are involved in the project!
